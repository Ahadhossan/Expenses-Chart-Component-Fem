To follow along, download/clone the code and open it in your code editor. Assuming you have npm installed, open a terminal in your code editor and type the following commands:

[npm i]

First installed Tailwind.css;

use this comment...

npm install -D tailwindcss

AND THEN â€¦

[npm run div]

That will kick off the tailwind script. Open the project with Live Server or something simliar. Enjoy! ðŸ˜ƒ
